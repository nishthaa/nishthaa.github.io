version  of  natural  language  text  into  structured  forms  to
enable machines to process them.  An important problem in
this effort is to extract time-sequence of events mentioned in

model to classify BEFORE, AFTER or OVERLAP relations
between  events  occuring  in  the  same  sentence.   We  pro-
pose  a  Random-Search  (RS)  based  technique  utilizing  the

time-vector to every event in the sentence.  For any pair of
events, the relative positions of their embeddings (or time-
vectors) enable us to classify them as BEFORE, AFTER or
OVERLAP.  We  have  tested  our  technique  on  verb  events
on TempEval 2010 and AQUAINT data sets and compared
performance  for  different  design  parameters  and  sentence
lengths.  We have obtained an accuracy of 96.55% on short
sentences and 85.9% on all-size sentences for 2-class classi-

racy of 76.19% on short sentences and 66.49% on all-size sen-
tences for 3-class classification as
