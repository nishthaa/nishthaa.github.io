Governmental authorities publish rules and directives that govern the operations of an industry. These documents, called regulations, are meant to safeguard the interests of consumers. With increasing number, size and complexity of such documents, companies face an uphill task to comply with them. We present a cognitive system, called Cogpliance, for exploring and understanding regulatory documents with the goal of assisting compliance officers in attaining regulatory compliance. Cogpliance automatically reads natural language regulatory documents, extracts key concepts and presents an interactive information exploration user interface for answering compliance officers queries.
