01/10/17	Extracting Temporal Relations from Dependency-Trees Using Edge Embeddings	Intl. Conf. on Management of Data	"This paper is abOne of the critical step in cognitive computing today is con-
version  of  natural  language  text  into  structured  forms  to
enable machines to process them.  An important problem in
this effort is to extract time-sequence of events mentioned in
a sentence.  In this paper we present a supervised learning
model to classify BEFORE, AFTER or OVERLAP relations
between  events  occuring  in  the  same  sentence.   We  pro-
pose  a  Random-Search  (RS)  based  technique  utilizing  the
grammatical  dependency  parse-tree  of  a  sentence  to  learn
a  model  for  classification.   Our  learning  model  assigns  a
time-vector to every event in the sentence.  For any pair of
events, the relative positions of their embeddings (or time-
vectors) enable us to classify them as BEFORE, AFTER or
OVERLAP.  We  have  tested  our  technique  on  verb  events
on TempEval 2010 and AQUAINT data sets and compared
performance  for  different  design  parameters  and  sentence
lengths.  We have obtained an accuracy of 96.55% on short
sentences and 85.9% on all-size sentences for 2-class classi-
fication as
{
before,after
}
.  We have also obtained an accu-
racy of 76.19% on short sentences and 66.49% on all-size sen-
tences for 3-class classification as
{
before,after,overlap

24/07/17	Neev: A cognitive support agent for content improvement in hardware tickets	"Integrated Network and Service Management (IM), 2017 IFIP/IEEE Symposium on"	"IT service providers differentiate themselves through offering after-sales support for hardware and software products. Thus, businesses, including large corporations, have intricate work-flows for servicing such support requests while reducing man-hours needed. These work-flows generally operate through a ticketing system for resolving customer issues. A lot of man-hours are spent in searching old tickets for correct problem and resolution for such issues. Support requests pertaining to enterprise hardware are more challenging than desktop support for end-user products. Enterprise hardware requires deeper diagnosis involving several systems and expertise of multiple agents. In this work we propose a cognitive agent, Neev, which helps in mitigating the problem in a three-fold fashion (1) retrieving a summary of relevant ticket text (2) Tagging the relevant parts as a part-of-the-problem or a part-of-the-solution (3 …"	"N.

02/07/18	A System for Predicting Health of an e-Contract	2018 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)	"Large corporates and government institutions tend to have multi-year service engagements with IT-vendors who provide various kinds of infrastructure and management services including software, servers, IT - security, facility management etc. The engagements are formalized as legal contracts. Given the legal binding and the natural expectation to renew, there is a need to constantly monitor the performance against the stated objectives. Typically, a principle investigator or an account executive hold the responsibilities of deliverables and perform corrective actions as and when required. Given the complexity of the language and various variables involved, it is extremely difficult to proactively detect performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of contract health and describe Fitcon - a contract mining system that detects service level agreements from contracts, tracks the delivery performance "	"N Madaan, S Mujumdar, S Srivastava, A Gupta… - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Services …, 2018"	paper-title-number-5	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8456401/
02/07/18	A Change Tracking Framework for Financial Documents	2018 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC)	"Businesses need to adhere to certain regulations to remain compliant. They want to expand or move to a new geography and find itself subject to a slightly different set of regulations. Also, regulations themselves change over time and force the business to change its internal working to remain compliant. When a compliance officer is presented with a new regulatory document, he has to manually compare corresponding sentences between previous and the new version. While most studies in text mining have focused on measuring textual similarity, textual entailment detection and paraphrase identification etc., there has been very little focus on the problem of change tracking (CT). Change tracking can be defined as the task of identifying the phrase pair(s) that captures the semantic difference between two given sentences, and plays an important role in domains such as financial regulatory compliance where core …"	"N Madaan, G Singh, S Bedathur, A Kumar - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Services …, 2018"	paper-title-number-6	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8456404/

These documents, called regulations, are meant to safeguard the interests of consumers. With increasing number, size and complexity of such documents, companies face an uphill task to comply with them. We present a cognitive system, called Cogpliance, for exploring and understanding regulatory documents with the goal of assisting compliance officers in attaining regulatory compliance. Cogpliance automatically reads natural language regulatory documents, extracts key concepts and presents an interactive information exploration user interface for answering compliance officers queries."

Compliance with such regulations is getting increasingly hard due both to the complexity of these documents, which require experts to read, understand, and interpret them manually, and to the sheer volume of regulatory change. Many CFOs rate this as their top challenge. The authors' Cogpliance platform uses a cognitive approach to achieve regulatory compliance. Here, they describe key compliance-related tasks and demonstrate how Cogpliance helps compliance officers to handle those tasks effectively."

21/01/18	"Analyze, Detect and Remove Gender Stereotyping from Bollywood Movies"	"Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency"	"The presence of gender stereotypes in many aspects of society is a well-known phenomenon. In this paper, we focus on studying such stereotypes and bias in Hindi movie industry (\it Bollywood) and propose an algorithm to remove these stereotypes from text. We analyze movie plots and posters for all movies released since 1970. The gender bias is detected by semantic modeling of plots at sentence and intra-sentence level. Different features like occupation, introductions, associated actions and descriptions are captured to show the pervasiveness of gender bias and stereotype in movies. Using the derived semantic graph, we compute centrality of each character and observe similar bias there. We also show that such bias is not applicable for movie posters where females get equal importance even though their character has little or no impact on the movie plot. The silver lining is that our system was able to identify 30 movies over last 3 years where such stereotypes were broken. The next step, is to generate debiased stories. The proposed debiasing algorithm extracts gender biased graphs from unstructured piece of text in stories from movies and de-bias these graphs to generate plausible unbiased stories."
